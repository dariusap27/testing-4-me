Joonam follows the documentarian, who has very little to no proficiency in the Persian language, as she listens to and records her grandmother’s stories in Persian. As Urich describes in her interview with Leyla Shams on the language learning podcast Chai and Conversation, the making of this film, especially transcribing her grandmother’s speech after her death, was a huge part of her language learning process and the process of getting to know her grandmother in her native tongue. While semantic understanding came later, the present moment of listening was characterized by a different kind of understanding for Urich, one guided by listening to her grandmother’s intonations, inflections, and the “soul” in the voice, as Aristotle wrote. \n\nAlong with the transcription of Urich's and Shams interview, I am writing a braided essay that includes both personal narrative and research as it explores language learning and the struggle of self expression in diasporic communities, through the lens of non-Western and spiritual listening practices, specifically the practice of sama, a devotional listening practice that finds its origins in Sufi mysticism. The filmmaking process of the film Joonam emphasizes the importance of sound recording devices as they push the temporal bounds of listening, and insists on the importance of those recordings as they contribute to spiritual and timeless connection and interaction with one's beloveds.
