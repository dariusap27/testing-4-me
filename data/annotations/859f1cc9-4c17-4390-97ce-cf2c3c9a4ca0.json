Maybe one day the political situation will get better. As a child, I took this family refrain at face value. Growing up in rural Vermont in an English-speaking household, my mother's memories were the only window I had to understand my cultural identity. Visiting Iran was never on the table, and because of that, I grew up without much connection to it. My father was American, my friends were American, and I was American. The fact that my mother was from Persia, as she preferred me to say, an ancient empire absent from modern maps, was just a fun fact that made me feel exotic and mysterious. But in reality, for me, Iran was just food and holidays. Anything more was out of reach. Joonam was born out of my deep, dormant, and unresolved desire to feel connected to Iran. Today, Iran is on the cusp of another revolution, and this time the fight for freedom is being led by women and girls. These last few months, I have been glued to the news in my social media feed, moved by the images of resistance and unimaginable bravery coming out of the country, and heartbroken to witness the horrific crackdown against young people asking for basic human rights. Iranians are fighting not only to liberate a country, but also an entire culture. And for Iranians living in the diaspora, this has seismic implications. The yearning that compelled me to make this film was born from the same profound desire, a longing to inherit more than exile from our families, a longing for home, a longing for our very identities.\""}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Leyla Shams"},{"category":"Type","tag":"Transcript"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Diaspora"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Revolution"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Identity"}],"uuid":"f1bd404f-d6ae-4f73-b9cf-9fb9db0154ca"},{"start_time":151,"end_time":157,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"And with that, let's get on to the interview.

Good. Yeah. Yeah. As soon as I, I had the exact same experience, as soon as I started looking into you and your work and your, I was like, oh yeah, exactly, this is who I need to be talking to a hundred percent. I started this project in 2009 as a kind of response to the Green Movement that was happening and just the post-9/11, you know. Yeah. I felt like Iran was in the news all the time and in such a negative way, and then I realized, you know, one of the ways that we can really connect with each other and, like, show the beauty of a culture is through language. That's, you know, it's a, when you can learn the language of a people, you can really understand them. And then I looked around and I was like, there's no good language resources. And my mom actually was a, like, she had the first Persian class in Dallas where she would get me and a group of friends together to teach us how to read and write and, like, how to keep the language alive. It was very important to her to keep the language alive. So I started this project and over the years, I keep thinking, like, surely a resource will come along with like a lot of, you know, money behind them or a lot of, more resources than I have and just make the best program ever. So I've just, you know, slowly been working on this and like every year, I'm like, not, still nothing. No one. Hello. Is it, is there anybody out there? It is shocking until, you know, recently someone asked me, well, what are the business uses of learning Persian? And then I was like, oh, right. There's like sanctions against Iran. There's not like a bunch of businessmen going over there and like learning. So of course nobody wants to teach this language. The only reason people learn is, you know, to, because they've married an Iranian or they, you know, grew up in a Iranian household, didn't grow up speaking or it's all because of just like love, you know, love of people, love of the language, whatever. And there's no, like, money in that. So no one comes in and like, or there's not a business implication for it. So I feel like maybe that's the reason that there's not."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Leyla Shams"},{"category":"Type","tag":"Transcript"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Language Learning"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Love"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Sanctions"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Connection"}],"uuid":"20fde9a3-044b-4f6d-81ea-958e84f2836c"},{"start_time":3192,"end_time":3296,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"That's so fascinating. Yeah. Actually, now that you say that, that was the overwhelming experience in making this film is that you're trying to learn the language and there's not a ton of resources and then, you know, you find a teacher and then politics, you know, got in the way of that where suddenly now I can't even learn the language because this person has, you know, gotten a job that makes it such that it's not okay for them to be teaching me anymore. Or, you know, I can't mail something back and forth to Iran because of sanctions. I can't go to Iran, you know, because my family has raised me with this idea that it's too dangerous, and there's a number of reasons why it might not be wise for me to go. I can't go to Iran even if I wanted to with any sort of ease because it's my mother who is Iranian, not my father. And so I can't get a passport because I'm half from the wrong side because we don't recognize women. And so it felt like every step of the way, there's a barrier and, you know, like, oh, maybe I'll just do a Google Street View. Oh, yeah, of course, Google Street View doesn't exist in Iran. And so it felt like, okay, the only thing available to me are like these family photos, maybe some YouTube videos with someone's like editing and music on top of them. What sort of direct relationship can you have with this place? And that's what's so frustrating sometimes is you just want to feel connected to your family or your identity. And politics is suffused in everything we do because of this authoritarian regime and the complexities between the U.S. and Iran specifically as well. But, yeah, it's so fascinating that you say that because of course, you know, of course, that's why there aren't these resources."}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Speakers","tag":"Sierra Urich"},{"category":"Type","tag":"Transcript"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Gender Roles"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Family Dynamics"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Diaspora"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Connection"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Identity"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Politics"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Sanctions"}],"uuid":"d59193ec-b215-4ef8-8b76-7aa8855015e9"},{"start_time":3296,"end_time":3346,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Right, right.
